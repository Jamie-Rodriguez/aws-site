      This page gives a brief overview of some projects I have completed. The GitHub repo's <code>README.md</code> files go into more detail if you are curious.
    </p>
    <h1>Learning to Play Blackjack through <em>Deep Reinforcement Learning</em></h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/RL-Blackjack">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/RL-Blackjack</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using OpenAI Gym for the environment, I created an agent that can learn to play blackjack with the most optimal strategy through <em>deep reinforcement learning (RL)</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before moving to full function approximation, I first implemented a tabular method of Monte Carlo sampling. This was to test and ensure that the RL algorithm was functioning correctly, <em>before</em> adding a neural network on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I was satisfied with the RL algorithm, it was time to replace the state-action table with a function approximator - in this case a neural network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep reinforcement learning agent was able to converge to the optimal solution, however it took much longer than simpler tabular method. This is an expected cost of using function approximation over tabular methods however.

    <h1>Tic-Tac-Clojure</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/tic-tac-clojure">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/tic-tac-clojure</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Implemented a tic-tac-toe game engine in Clojure, in a pure functional style, using a modern Clojure stack (CLI + Deps).
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this for two reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          To learn <em>modern</em> Clojure development, specifically using CLI + Deps with unit testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          To use this engine/environment in the future to experiment with reinforcement learning agents.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h1>Microservice Web-API</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/microservice-web-api">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/microservice-web-api</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that this repository can serve as an easy to understand, minimal example for "containerising" (and orchestrating) a microservice-style web server application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally important is the example of a modern Clojure webserver - as all the resources I could find were using much older, deprecated libraries. I hope this can be a useful reference for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually I hope for this example to be as close to a production-ready system as possible i.e. it will have containerisation, orchestration, scalability and observability to ensure as much reliability as possible. But that's enough buzzwords for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps way in the future I will also add capability to deploy this system to a cloud environment, probably using a platform-agnostic tool such as Terraform.

    <h1>Infrastructure as Code - AWS Static Site</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/aws-site">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/aws-site</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      AWS Infrastructure as Code to deploy a static site fully automatically (and cheaply). It's how this site is deployed!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To deploy site: run <code>deploy.sh</code></li>
      <li>To teardown all resources: run <code>teardown.sh</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See GitHub link for details of the resources and architecture created.
    </p>

    <h1>C: Command Line Arguments Processing</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/C_Command_Line_Args_Processing">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/C_Command_Line_Args_Processing</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>getopt.h</code> is the most popular library used to process command line arguments in C. However I found it a bit cumbersome to use as well as not as flexible as required for my uses. As well as this, it is not a standard library and so is not guaranteed to be present on all systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technique is pretty simple, I use a hash function to compare the command line flags inside a <code>switch</code> statement. I find this cleaner and safer than using something like <code>strcmp()</code> in this specific case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GitHub repo contains two code examples to inspect <code>getopt.h</code> vs my hash method.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I write this, I think I should be able to use C macros to automatically hash the command line flags at the preprocessor stage, rather than manually as it is done currently. If I revisit this in the future I will add this in.
