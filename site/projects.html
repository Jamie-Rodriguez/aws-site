      This page gives a brief overview of some projects I have completed. The GitHub repos&rsquo; <code>README.md</code> files go into more detail if you are curious.

    <h1>Learning to Play Blackjack through <em>Deep Reinforcement Learning</em></h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/RL-Blackjack">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/RL-Blackjack</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using OpenAI Gym for the environment, I created an agent that can learn to play blackjack with the most optimal strategy through <em>deep reinforcement learning (RL)</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before moving to full function approximation, I first implemented a tabular method of Monte Carlo sampling. This was to test and ensure that the RL algorithm was functioning correctly, <em>before</em> adding a neural network on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I was satisfied with the RL algorithm, it was time to replace the state-action table with a function approximator - in this case a neural network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep reinforcement learning agent was able to converge to the optimal solution, however it took much longer than simpler tabular method. This is an expected cost of using function approximation over tabular methods however.

    <h1>Tic-Tac-Clojure</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/tic-tac-clojure">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/tic-tac-clojure</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Implemented a tic-tac-toe game engine in Clojure, in a pure functional style, using a modern Clojure stack (CLI + Deps).
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this for two reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          To learn the <em>modern</em>, in-built Clojure development ecosystem, specifically using CLI + Deps with unit testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          To use this engine/environment in the future to experiment with reinforcement learning agents.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h1>Adventures in Modern C Development: HTTP Server</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/c-http-server">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/c-http-server</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Minimal example of a HTTP server using the POSIX <em>sockets</em> library, written in C.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this project simply to see how difficult it is to write a HTTP server using C. Would I recommend it? Unless it is a simple server, I would say&mldr; &ldquo;<em>no</em>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      However I think that this repo is useful as a template for a modern C project that includes unit testing for test-driven development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I organised this project with a more modern, yet minimal project structure; featuring unit testing using the lightweight library <a href="https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity">Unity</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remain minimalistic, this project only uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> for it&rsquo;s buildsystem. The <code>makefile</code> makes use of Make&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html">pattern rules</a>&rdquo; so that you don&rsquo;t need to individually include a file in both the runtime and unit-testing builds every time you add a new file to the project.

    <h1>Infrastructure as Code - AWS Static Site</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/aws-site">https://github.com/Jamie-Rodriguez/aws-site</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      AWS Infrastructure as Code to deploy a static site fully automatically (and cheaply). It&rsquo;s how this site is deployed!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To deploy site: run <code>deploy.sh</code></li>
      <li>To teardown all resources: run <code>teardown.sh</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See GitHub link for details of the resources and architecture created.
